                  <br>Living your truth changes everything.</br>
                  <br>My name is Becky Dowling. I help my clients gently peel away the layers that are hiding who they truly are. With a deeper, clearer understanding of themselves, they learn to make decisions that are fulfilling and empowering, transforming their lives. And they come to truly appreciate who they are.</br>
                  <br>Coaching accelerates progress by providing greater focus and awareness of choice, as well as accountability and support. The coaching relationship is one of equality in which I support my clients in finding their own answers to, or way of being with, the issues that are frustrating them now and the bumps in the road that they encounter on their journeys. The atmosphere is often playful as they move towards meeting their goals, and ultimately create a fabulous and fulfilling life for themselves.</br>
                  <br>I am an International Coach Federation Associate Certified Coach, a Certified Professional Co-Active Coach, and I have an M.A. in Community Counseling. I have been coaching since 2006.</br>
